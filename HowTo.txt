how to build:

  mkdir build 
  cd build 
  cmake .. 
  make 
  
how to run 

  JsonParser -i input_file -o output_file 

check program usage 
  JsonParser --help
  
  
Note - boost property tree treats elements of json array with key equal to empty string and 
it seems that does not support stable sorting. Due to this the output can be different than expected. 
This issue can be solved with using stable sorting.
